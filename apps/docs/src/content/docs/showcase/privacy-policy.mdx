The React Native Reusables App (“the App”) is an interactive developer tool that allows users to explore, preview, and interact with a wide range of UI components and blocks provided by the React Native Reusables project. It is designed for developers and designers who want to evaluate, learn from, and integrate these components into their own applications.

### 1. Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.
At this time, the App does not require authentication and does not track user behavior, usage statistics, or analytics data.

### 2. Authentication
No authentication mechanisms are currently implemented. If authentication is added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect that change.

### 3. Data Usage and Sharing
Since we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties.
